# Z Planner

**Z Planner** is a productivity and time-tracking app designed to help you monitor how much time you spend on tasks and activities. It is inspired by those days where we lose track of time and suddenly find ourselves asking where the day went. 

* My very first app. The pioneer of Undebugged App Series *
